### Breast_Cancer_Final_Project

# Breast Cancer Prediction Model
#### Final Project - "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning." - Winston Churchill.

## Overview:

#### In this project our team will use data from the Winsconsin University Research Lab in order to identify breast cancer using historical data to help predict malignant or benign cancer trends. The Project will be divided in different segments to demonstrate our skills with the different tools learned in class.

#### First off we will clean and process the data and build a database with SQL. Second with 70% of our data, we will build a model that is trained to classify the information and predict predict the trend. Third, we will build different visualizations of the whole project with Tableau to finalize the project with our results.

#### We will use 4 different .csv files that contain related information obtained by a study in the Winsconsin University Research Lab. The datasets contain the following information.

#### * Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) (3-32)
#### * radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
#### * texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
#### * perimeter
#### * area
#### * smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
#### * compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
#### * concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
#### * concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
#### * symmetry
#### * fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
