# Breast_Cancer_Final_Project

"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning." - Winston Churchill.

## Overview
In this project, our team will use data from the Wisconsin University Research Lab in order to identify breast cancer using historical data to help predict malignant or benign cancer trends. The Project will be divided in different segments to demonstrate our skills with the different tools learned in class.
First off we will clean and process the data and build a database with SQL. Second with 70% of our data, we will build machine learning model that is trained to classify the information and predict the trend. Third, we will build different visualizations of the whole project with Tableau to finalize the project with our results.

## Machine Learning Model

## Data Sources
data_diagnosis.csv, data_mean.csv, data_se.csv, data_worst.csv, data.csv
We will use 4 different .csv files listed above that contain related information obtained by a study in the Winsconsin University Research Lab. The datasets contain the following information.
* Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) (3-32)
* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Questions to Answer



## Communication Protocols 
In order to stay up to date on the final project, we message each other frequently through Slack on a seperate channel created for the project. Any other questions or concerns that arise outside of our daily check-ins, we address during class, in our group organized Zoom meetings outside of class, and during office hours with the TA. 

Machine Learning Model
For our ml model we will start with converterning our dataset to categorical data or text data into numbers so our predictive model works better, we will split the data into training

## Software Used:
* SQL
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Collab Notebook
* Extracting data from CSV file
* Python for cleaning the data, creating data frames with pandas, merging, eliminating columns not needed, creating machine learning model
* Tableau to create Dashboard and Visualizations
* MatPlotLib to create charts and graphs as part of Data Visualizations
